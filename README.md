# leetcode

A repo to store all my solutions for various leetcode problems in various programming languages. Languages used so far:

- Go

---

## Two Sum

- Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
- Solution languages:
  - Go

## Valid Parentheses

- Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:

  - Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

  - Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

- Solution languages:
  - Go

## Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists

- You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2. Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. Return the head of the merged linked list.

- Solution languages:
  - Go

## Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock

- You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

- Solution languages:
  - Go

## Valid Palindrome

- A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers. Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

- Solution languages:
  - Go

## Invert Binary Tree

- Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

- Solution languages:
  - Go

## Valid Anagram

- Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

- Solution languages:
  - Go

## Binary Search

- Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

- Solution languages:
  - Go
